Simulate a white blood cell eliminating the bacteria in order to prevent them from splitting in two and harming the host.  WASD for movement and control.  Mouse to fire.  Mitosis launches a smaller white blood cell at the bacteria, killing on impact.

Features:

<li> Vertical Scroller</li>
<li> Progressively Harder Levels</li>
<li> Score Counter</li>
<li> Educational Screens on each Infection</li>

### Empirical Formula Solver

The empirical formula of a molecule is the relative number of elements in a molecule.  
This program will take in the values of percents of atoms in an unknown molecule, calculate the amount of each atom in the molecule, and then return the Empirical Formula of the molecule.

Currently, I will be using an enum for the elements created by @felixdivo

The Program takes in the number of elements the user wants to calculate for (max 5).

The user enters values for elements and percents and the compound is returned to the user.

The option to see the steps taken to get to the final result is available after a calculation has been done.

This will be displayed using Swing.  All numbers will be estimates to the best the program can do.

### Tanker Truck Calculator

This program was my first attempt in the 2016-17 School Year at creating a standalone application using Java Swing.  This program was the testing
This program takes the estimated lifetime, amount of water drunk per day, and name of a user to return how many 11,000 gallon tanker trucks of water the user will drink in their lifetime.
