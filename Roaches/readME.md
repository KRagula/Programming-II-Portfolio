# Roaches Viewers

A collection of two different displays for simulating a population of cockroaches.

The first class, RoachPopulationViewer, displays an interactive GUI to modify and change the values of the population of
roaches.  It also has an exterminator come every 10 seconds to kill 10% of the population

GUI

The second class, RoachSimulation visualizes the growth of a roach population over a timeframe of 10 generations.  A timer waits
1/2 of a second before either doubling the population or killing a portion of the population.  The simulation lasts 10 seconds.
